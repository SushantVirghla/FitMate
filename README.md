this is my first react native expo project and also first project i ever created.
thats why this code contains some unnecessary dependencies and files also including images.
working perfectly but very cluttered and unorganized.


# Setup Instructions

1. Install Node.js and npm
   Make sure you have Node.js version 18 or newer installed on your computer.
   Download from: https://nodejs.org/

2. Install Expo CLI globally:
   ```bash
  npm install -g expo-cli

3. Install all dependencies:
   npm install

4.install Expo Go app on your phone android/IOS
  or you can setup simulator in your device in case you dont want to use your phone, i used simulator in my macbook 
 and setup of simulator is complicated, i suggest download Expo Go app in your phone.

5.Start the project : npx expo start --tunnel.
  if you setup simulator you will button you need to press respective platform in simulator IOS/Android.
  if you are using Expo Go its simple after executing command open Expo Go app in phone and scan QR which is in your 
  terminal. Can be accessed from different network also.

6.as project include many dependencies so while running if you face any error of missing dependencies just copy error 
 and past in CHatGPT,CLaudeAI,etc it will give you command required to install the dependencies.I cant list all 
 dependencies command here there are so many.
